# VASP Tutorial on Borah

This tutorial will guide you through the process of performing an electronic structure calculation using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) on the [Your Cluster Name].

## Step 1: Load the VASP Module

On the cluster, software applications are managed through "modules." To use VASP, you must first load its module.

```module load vasp/6.0.0```

## Step 2: Confirm VASP Module is Loaded

You can verify that the VASP module is loaded by listing all currently active modules:

module list

Ensure that `vasp/6.0.0` is among the listed modules.

## Step 3: Prepare Input Files

VASP requires several input files to run a calculation. The primary files are:

- `INCAR`: Specifies the calculation parameters.
- `POSCAR`: Provides the atomic positions.
- `KPOINTS`: Defines the k-point mesh for Brillouin zone sampling.
- `POTCAR`: Contains the pseudopotentials for the elements.

Make sure these files are prepared correctly in your working directory.

## Step 4: Create a Job Script

To run VASP on the cluster, you need to create a job script for the Slurm scheduler. Below is a template that you can save as `vasp_slurm.sh`.
```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J vasp_job             # job name
#SBATCH -o vasp_output.o%j      # output and error file name (%j expands to jobID)
#SBATCH -n 48                   # number of cores
#SBATCH -p [partition_name]     # partition name, replace with your cluster's partition
#SBATCH -t 12:00:00             # time (hh:mm:ss)

# Run this script in the folder containing your VASP input files with:
# sbatch vasp_slurm.sh

# Print some job details
echo "Job details:"
echo "Date: $(date)"
echo "Hostname: $(hostname -s)"
echo "Directory: $(pwd)"
echo "Nodes allocated: $SLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES"
echo "Tasks allocated: $SLURM_NTASKS"
echo "Cores per task: $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK"
echo ""

# Load VASP module if not already loaded
module load vasp/6.0.0

# Run VASP
mpirun vasp_std
```
Remember to replace `[partition_name]` with the appropriate partition for your cluster.

## Step 5: Submit the Job

With your job script and input files in the working directory, submit the job to the Slurm queue:

sbatch vasp_slurm.sh

## Step 6: Monitor the Job

You can check the status of your job using:

squeue -u [your_username]

Replace `[your_username]` with your actual username on the cluster.

## Step 7: Analyze the Output

After the job finishes, VASP will generate several output files including `OUTCAR`, `CONTCAR`, `OSZICAR`, and possibly `CHGCAR` and `WAVECAR`, depending on your calculation. You can analyze these files to obtain results such as the total energy, electronic structure, and optimized geometry.
