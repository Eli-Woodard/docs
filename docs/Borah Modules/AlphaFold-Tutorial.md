# AlphaFold Guide on Borah Cluster

This tutorial will guide you through the process of running protein structure prediction using AlphaFold on the Borah cluster.

## Step 1: Prepare Directories

Create two new directory for AlphaFold, as well as input and output directories.

```bash
mkdir alphafoldTest
mkdir alphafold_output

cd alphafoldTest

mkdir input
mkdir output
```

## Step 3: Load Necessary Modules

Borah uses a system called "modules" to manage software. You need to load the necessary modules for AlphaFold.

```bash
module load slurm
module load alphafold
```

## Step 4: Set Environment Variables

Set the DATA_DIR and OUTPUT_DIR environment variables.

```bash
export DATA_DIR=/bsuscratch/alphafold_data
export OUTPUT_DIR=/bsuscratch/${USER}/alphafold_output
```

## Step 5: Prepare Input Files

You need to create a `query.fasta` file in the `input` directory and put your sequences in it. The content should be in FASTA format, as shown below:

```bash
>dummy_sequence
GWSTELEKHREELKEFLKKEGITNVEIRIDNGRLEVRVEGGTERLKRFLEELRQKLEKKGYTVDIKIE
```

## Step 6: Submit the Job

Below is the content of an example job submission script. You can use this as a template to create your own job submission script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J Alphafold      # job name
#SBATCH -o log_slurm.o%j  # output and error file name (%j expands to jobID)
#SBATCH -N 1              # number of nodes you want to run on
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:2
#SBATCH -p gpu            # queue (partition) -- bsudfq, eduq, gpuq, shortq
#SBATCH -t 12:00:00       # run time (hh:mm:ss) - 12.0 hours in this example.

# Load the necessary modules
module load slurm
module load alphafold

# Set the environment variables
export OUTPUT_DIR=/bsuscratch/${USER}/alphafold_output
export DATA_DIR=/bsuscratch/alphafold_data

# Execute the program:
run_alphafold.sh -d $DATA_DIR -o $OUTPUT_DIR -m model_1 -f ./input/query.fasta -t 2020-05-14

# Exit if mpirun errored:
status=$?
if [ $status -ne 0 ]; then
    exit $status
fi
# Do some post processing.
```

## Step 7: Check the Output

After the job is finished, you can find the predicted protein structures in the OUTPUT_DIR directory.
