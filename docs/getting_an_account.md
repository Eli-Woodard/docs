# Getting an Account
Connecting to R2 or Borah requires an account for that cluster provided by Research Computing. 
To request an account, please email researchcomputing@boisestate.edu with the following information: 

  - Name of requestor                          
  - Cluster you are requesting an account on   
  - Research project name or grant information
  - Name of your PI                            
  - Email address of requestor                 
    
In order to grant access, the HPC administrator will verify that you are a valid user by contacting the projectâ€™s PI.
When on the Boise State campus, the campus clusters can be accessed from most wired computers or from the secured Eduroam Wi-Fi network.
If you are off campus, a VPN connection must be used. 
The Boise State VPN is a virtual network connection that allows users to be on the internal network from off campus. 
More info on it can be found here: [vpn-services](https://www.boisestate.edu/oit-network/vpn-services/). 
The VPN is only accessible to current employees and student employees of Boise State, so if you need VPN access, please have your faculty advisor/PI contact the help desk to request VPN access on your behalf.
