# Appendix B: Glossary of Cluster Terms

**CPU, or “central processing unit”** – A computer component responsible for running the necessary functions of the computer like programs, the operating system, etc. Could be called the “brain” of the computer.

**Core** – A part of the CPU. CPUs are essentially a collection of cores, where the cores are the processors that actually make the CPU work. CPUs have different numbers of cores in them, depending upon the CPU model.

**GPU, “graphics processing unit”, or “graphics card”** – A computer component dedicated to processing graphics like those found in video games, animations, data visualizations, etc. GPUs are often used for non-graphical computing tasks because a single GPU is vastly more powerful than a single CPU (due to the much higher number of cores the GPU has) and because GPUs are particularly good at doing certain mathematical operations.

**CPU node** – A compute node equipped for running computational jobs on CPUs.

**GPU node** – A compute node equipped for running computational jobs on GPUs. Equipped on both R2 and Borah with the same number of CPU cores as a standard compute node.

**OS, or “operating system”** – A piece of software that allows someone to interface with a computer. Windows, Mac, and Linux are all examples of operating systems.

**Condo node** – A compute node in a compute cluster purchased by a research lab for their own use. Can be used by others through a certain job queue, but the lab that bought the node will always have priority.
