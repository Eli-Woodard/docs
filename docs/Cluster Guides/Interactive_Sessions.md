# Interactive Sessions

If youâ€™d like an environment to test code or job submissions in on R2, there are three commands available: dev-session, gpu-session, and debug-session. Running either of the two former commands will put you into a 12-hour long session on a CPU (dev-session) or GPU (gpu-session) node, while running the latter (debug-session) will place you into a half-hour long session on a CPU node. While in a session, you can freely run jobs directly from the command line (without using Slurm) in order to test and optimize them. It is strongly recommended that you use these interactive sessions to test jobs before submitting them to the job scheduler proper.

On Borah, these commands become `dev-session-bsu` and `debug-session-bsu`, with the same functionality as described above.
