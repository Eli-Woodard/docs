# **Storing Data**

There are two storage spaces available on the campus clusters: “home” space and “scratch” space, each with its own purpose.|
                                                                                                                           |
Home space is a small area that serves as your home directory on the cluster – this is the directory that you’re placed into upon logging in. Home directories are not visible to other users and are intended for your own personal storage, not for collaborative storage. They have a hard limit of 100 GB, with a warning sent at 75 GB. On R2, the home space for each user is located at /home/(R2 username); on Borah, it’s located at /bsuhome/(Borah username).
